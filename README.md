Project 1: Simple Chatbot Implementation
Implementation Steps:

Greeting Function:

Develop a function to greet the user upon initiation of the conversation.
Respond to Basic Questions:

Create a dictionary that holds basic questions and their corresponding responses.
Implement a function to process and respond to user queries using this dictionary.
Farewell Message:

Develop a function to bid the user farewell at the end of the interaction.
Remember Previous Interactions:

Use a dictionary to store details from previous interactions with the user.
Implement functions to save and retrieve these details, enabling context-aware conversations.
User Interaction Flow:

Design a conversation flow that ensures smooth interaction between the chatbot and the user.
Error Handling:

Implement a function to handle unrecognized inputs and provide friendly error messages.
Expanded Example Code (Python):

Provide a detailed Python example showcasing the implementation of the above steps.
Project 2: Basic Q&A Chatbot for College Admission
Implementation Steps:

Develop Q&A Responses:

Gather comprehensive information about college admission procedures, requirements, and deadlines.
Implement a function that can respond to user queries based on this information.
User Interaction Flow:

Design a conversation flow to manage admission-related queries, allowing the user to ask multiple questions in one session.
Contextual Understanding:

Enhance the chatbot's ability to remember context by storing user information from previous interactions.
Implement personalized responses based on this stored information.
Connect to Backend:

Integrate the chatbot with a backend server to fetch real-time information.
Ensure that the chatbot provides accurate and up-to-date responses.
Error Handling and Feedback:

Implement robust error handling for unrecognized queries.
Provide users with constructive feedback when their queries cannot be addressed.
Expanded Example Code (Python):

Example Backend Server (Flask):

Create a simple Flask server that serves admission-related information. Save this code in a file named app.py.
Chatbot with Backend Connection:

Modify the chatbot to fetch information from the backend server. Save this code in a file named chatbot.py.
Steps to Run the Backend and Chatbot:

Run the Flask Server:

Save the Flask server code in a file named app.py.
Start the server by running python app.py in your terminal. The server will start at http://127.0.0.1:5000/.
Run the Chatbot:

Save the chatbot code in a separate Python file (e.g., chatbot.py).
Execute the chatbot code, which will fetch real-time information from the running Flask server.
This setup allows the chatbot to retrieve real-time admission-related information from a backend server, ensuring responses are up-to-date and accurate.
